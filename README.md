# 4D FRAP Calculation

This is a **beta** product for lattice lightsheet data at the AIC. Use at your own risk.

This project relies heavily on the [matlab-utilities](https://github.com/ericwait/matlab-utilities) and the [lattice-light-sheet](https://github.com/aicjanelia/lattice-light-sheet) repositories. **Ensure** these two projects are available on your MATLAB path.

Look at [sandbox.m](https://github.com/aicjanelia/4d-frap-calculator/blob/master/sandbox.m) for usage.
